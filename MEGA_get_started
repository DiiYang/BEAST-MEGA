# Align the sequences
    Import sequences from file:
        Data > Open > Retrieve sequences from File > C1_test.fasta
    Align the sequences:
        Alignment > Align by Muscle > Align DNA 
            Note :  (1) ClustalW implements an iterative algorithm so mistakes produce in earlier step are quite unlikely to be corrected in later step
                    (2) Muscle (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) implements an progressive algorithm allowing re-optimizations of columns during the whole process
                    (3) Out of the two programs, choose Muscle
    Check the Muscle parameters 
    Compute and wait
    Export the aligned sequence:
        Data > Export Alignment > MEGA Format > C1_test.meg 

# Make a Neighbor Joining Tree
    In MEGA's main window, open the above file:
        File > Open a File/Session > C1_test.meg
    Construct phylogenetic tree:
        Phylogeny > Construct/Test Neighbor-Joining Tree > Yes > OK
    Save the Tree explorer:
         File > Save Current Sessions > C1_test.mtsx
