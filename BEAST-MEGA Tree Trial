# Step 1: Prepare the input alignment file 
    Open ebgC_aligned.mas in MEGA:
    Data > Export Alignment > Nexus format, save the file as ebgC.nxs 
    Optional : Data > Export Alignment > FASTA format, save the file as ebgC.fas 
               Open ebgC.fas in Seaview5
               File > Save as > Nexus format, save the file as ebgC.nxs 
        Note :  (1) BEAUTi cannot read FASTA file, so you need to convert the FASTA file to Nexus file first
                (2) MEGA can directly save the output file in Nexus format, if you are using an old version MEGA, this nexus format could be wrong for BEAUTi, in this case, save as FASTA formate and use Seaview5 to convert to Nexus format 

# Step 2: Run BEAUTi
    Start BEAUTi and import the file generated above:
    File > Import Data > ebgC.nxs 
        Note :  (1) Do not choose OPEN, BEAUTi cannot open files created by other applications, use Import option 
                (2) tab Partitions: basic information about the alignment
                (3) tab Taxa: 
                (4) tab Tips: a list of the taxa sequences, you cannot do anything with this list, but you can check to see that all the expected sequences are there
