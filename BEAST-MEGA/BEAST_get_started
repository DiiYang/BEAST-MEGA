# Softwares needed: 
    1. BEAST for windows (http://beast.community/install_on_windows) 
    2. Tracer for windows (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/ ; https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases) 
    3. FigTree for windows (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ; https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)
        Note:   (1) Package 1 includes five applications, BEAST, BEAUTi, TreeAnnotator, TreeStat, and LogCombiner
                (2) BEAUTi is where you set up all the conditions for your models, BEAUTi will wirte an .xml input file for BEAST
                (3) BEAST runs the Bayesian anlysis on your input file, and will write a .trees file consisting of a set of thousands of trees
                (4) TreeAnnotator helps to make the consensus tree with posterior probabilities as the statistic of reliability for each node
                (5) Tracer summarizes these trees and helps you to choose how many of the early created low-probability trees to discard from the final consensus tree (the burnin). It is most convinient to put Tracer into the BEAST folder along with other programs.
                (6) FigTree is a tree drawing program that is compatible with the trees written by BEAST and TreeAnnotator
    4. Java Runtime Environment / JRE (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
    5. BEAGLE library for windows (https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib/)
        Note: BEAGLE library is a high-performance library that can perform the core calculations at the heart of most Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics packages. It can make use of highly-parallel processors such as those in graphics cards found in many PCs.


# Input file format
    For BEAUTi: Nexus file (generated from MEGA, or MEGA-Seaview5, depending on the version of MEGA you may need to export the FASTA file from MEGA first and convert it to Nexus using Seaview5)
    For BEAST: BEAST xml file (generated from BEAUTi) or aligned FASTA file

# Basic steps for BEAUTi run 
    Use MEGA (or MEGA-Seaview5) to generate the proper input file for BEAUTi, input.nxs 
    Run BEAUTi
        Load the Nexus file
        Set the dates of the taxa
        Set the evolutionary models
        Set the molecular clock models
        Set the tree prior models
        Set Priors
        Set MCMC operators
        Check the MCMC options
        Save the settings
        Generate the BEAST xml file, input_name.xml

# Output file from BEAUTi run : input_name.xml

# Basic steps for BEAST run
    Load the BEAST xml file as input, input_name.xml
    Check if BEAGLE library available
    Run BEAST and wait, input_name.log, input_name.trees, input_name.ops 

# Output files from BEAST run : input_name.log, input_name.trees, input_name.ops
