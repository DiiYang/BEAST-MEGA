#### megacc on linux cluster ####

## Install MEGAX on linux cluster ##
# Download MEGAX from https://www.megasoftware.net/ and install on cluster
tar -zxvf megacc_10.1.8_amd64.tar.gz 
sudo dpkg -i megax-cc_10.1.8-1_amd64.deb
# Attahc the megacc to the working path
nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH="~/program/megacc/:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc


## Use megacc to generate multi sequence alignment ##

# Create setting.mao for megacc
# To do this, I need the windows MEGAX to set the parameters:
#       1) Go to MEGAX
#       2) Set mode to PROTOTYPE (right corner on the screen, below ANALYZE)
#       3) Set the data type as needed, mine: Nucleotide(Non-coding)
#       4) Choose the functions as needed, mine: MUSCLE DNA alignment
#       5) Check the parameters, and click on Save Settings, save it as muscle_align_nucleotide.mao
# Upload the setting.mao to cluster, and move it to the same folder as the fasta file that need to be analyzed
# Generate the multi sequence alignment
megacc -a muscle_align_nucleotide.mao -d PgiC1_demul_merged.fasta -o ./result/ -f Fasta 
megacc -a muscle_align_nucleotide.mao -d PgiC2_demul_unique.fasta -o ./result/ -f Fasta
