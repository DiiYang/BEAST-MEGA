# Softwares needed: 
1. BEAST for windows (http://beast.community/install_on_windows) 
2. Tracer for windows (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/ ; https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases) 
3. FigTree for windows (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ; https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)
    Note: (1) Package 1 includes five applications, BEAST, BEAUTi, TreeAnnotator, TreeStat, and LogCombiner
          (2) BEAUTi is where you set up all the conditions for your models, BEAUTi will wirte an .xml input file for BEAST
          (3) BEAST runs the Bayesian anlysis on your input file, and will write a .trees file consisting of a set of thousands of trees
          (4) TreeAnnotator helps to make the consensus tree with posterior probabilities as the statistic of reliability for each node
          (5) Tracer summarizes these trees and helps you to choose how many of the early created low-probability trees to discard from the final consensus tree (the burnin). It is most convinient to put Tracer into the BEAST folder along with other programs.
          (6) FigTree is a tree drawing program that is compatible with the trees written by BEAST and TreeAnnotator
4. Java Runtime Environment / JRE (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
5. BEAGLE library for windows (https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib/)
    Note: BEAGLE library is a high-performance library that can perform the core calculations at the heart of most Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics packages. It can make use of highly-parallel processors such as those in graphics cards found in many PCs.
